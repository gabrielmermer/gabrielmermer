This is a boardgame made for learning Spanish vocabulary.

The players have to collect three cards of one noun do gain a point, and the collecting of cards is done by asking anyone if they have such of an card (provided that we do, we can't ask for card we don't have). If the asked player doesn't have a card, the asker has to draw one card from the deck. 

The game ends when one person gains three points.

* Players: 2-4
* Time: 15 minutes
