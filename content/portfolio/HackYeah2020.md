# Second place on biggest Hackaton in Europe

Our team won a second place in the HackYeah 2020 hackaton in the WWF challenge.

## The challenge

The task that we had to acomplish was to made a system for registering, tracking and distribution of RFID tags on fishing nets used in Baltic Sea to prevent
pollution ([video about the subject](https://youtu.be/HBEg317ImHM))

My role on the team was UXUI Speciallist & Team leader & Ful Stack developer.

## Our solution

*The main interface*

We created a webapp with front-end made in Bootstrap framework, and connected it to MySQL database in the back-end. The solution was cheap to run, centralised system that allowed for creation, edition and removal of fishing nets from the datase with use of simple UI.
